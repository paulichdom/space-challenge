# Space Challenge - Mission To Mars

### Udacity course: OOP in JAVA 

Project task: launch and land success rate simulation for two 2 rocket prototypes.

The mission is to send a list of items (Habitats, bunkers, food supplies, and rovers) to Mars, but we need to run some simulations first to pick the correct fleet of rockets.

Two rocket prototypes are already designed.
Main goal: design and run some simulations to help decide which rocket type to use.

U-1

The U-1 Rocket is light weight, agile and pretty safe, but can only carry a total of 18 tonnes of cargo. It costs $100 Million to build and weighs 10 tonnes. It has a slim chance of crashing while landing but a bigger chance of exploding when launching, both chances depend on the amount of cargo carried in the rocket.

U-2

The U2 Rocket heavier than the U-1 but much safer and can carry a lot more cargo; to a total of 29 tonnes. However, it costs $120 Million to build and weighs 18 tonnes. It has a greater chance of crashing while landing than while launching, but just like the U-1 both chances depend on the amount of cargo carried.
The Mission

The mission consists of 2 phases:

Phase-1:

This phase is meant to send building equipment and construction material to help build the colony. In the resources tab, you will find a text file that contains the list of all items that we need to send called 'Phase-1.txt`. Each line in the file contains the item name as well as its weight in Kgs.

Phase-2:

This phase is meant to send the colony of humans along with some food resources. In the resources tab, you will find a text file that contains the list of all items that we need to send called 'Phase-2.txt`. Each line in the file also contains the item name and its weight in Kgs.

Run some simulations and test both rocket types for each phase separately to determine the success rate of rocket fleets.
